    // following https://javascript.info/comparison
    
    // Basic comparisons (and practicing template strings):
    let result = 2==2;
    console.log(`Does 2 equal 2? ${result}`);
    result = 2 < 2;
    console.log(`Is 2 less than 2? ${result}`);

    // String comparisons (apparently works similarly to strcmp in C, as it also compares unicode):
    console.log(`Is a equal to A? ${"a" == "A"};
    What about "dawn" equal "dawn" ${"dawn" === "dawn"};
    And c bigger than C ${"c" > "C"}`);

    // Comparison of different types (js turns chars into numbers if you use normal equality, strict one doesn't do dat)
    // Normal inequalities turn null to 0 and undefined to NaN, while normal equality is whacky for null
    console.log(`Is "2" === 2? ${"2" === 2};
    what about "2" == 2? ${"2" == 2}
    Is null == undefined? ${null == undefined}
    Is null bigger than 0? ${null > 0}
    is it >= 0? ${null >= 0}
    Then surely null == 0? ${null == 0}`) // null only == undefined

    // undefined doesnt compare to anything, vause it gets converted to NaN
    console.log (`Is undefined less or equal to infinity? ${undefined <= Infinity}`)
