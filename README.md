# webdev-delib-practice
Web Dev related practical exercises, that don't deserve a separate repository, but which are still a major part of my learning journey.

### Goals of this repository:
1. Keep track of my web development learning process (mostly following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "Odin Project") and the recommended resources) with appropriate documentation and comments.
2. Improve my github skills (commit messages, branches, merges).
3. Deliberate practice of webdev topics (single focus point per exercise, no straying):
   - Vanilla Javascript fundamentals (data types, basic algos, oop, DOM manipulation)
   - CSS + HTML (responsive static sites, flexbox + grid, UX, accessability)
   - API calls + Async JS
   - JS testing
   - React JS 
   - Node JS
