# Learning Goals:
- factory functions as alternative to constructors (*object inheritance and creation are unified into one function*)
- understand downsides and bugs of constructors (*objects become instances of the constructor functions, which isn't intuitive*)
- inheritance in factory functions (*done with either object.assign() or by destructuring*)
- JS scope + ES6 changes (*var vs let and const*)
- private functions and closure (*the main idea is that children can have all the desserts and sweets the parents have, but parents can't even touch any cookie their children have. Same with stacked functions. To open up the cookies for everyone, you need to return em as functions...*)
- basics of the module pattern
- what's IIFE?
- write short prototypes for tictactoe possibly using all that knowledge
