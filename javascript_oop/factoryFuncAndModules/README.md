# Learning Goals:
- factory functions as alternative to constructors (*object inheritance and creation are unified into one function*)
- understand downsides and bugs of constructors (*objects become instances of the constructor functions, which isn't intuitive*)
- inheritance in factory functions
- JS scope + ES6 changes
- private functions
- Closure: what it is, how it impacts private functions and variables
- basics of the module pattern
- whats IIFE?
- write short prototypes for tictactoe possibly using all that knowledge
